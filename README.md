## 📋 About The Project

The Secure Student Management System addresses the critical need for educational institutions to efficiently manage student data while maintaining the highest security standards. This application provides a centralized platform for administrators, instructors, and students to access and manage academic information securely.

**Problem It Solves:**
- Manual student record management leading to errors and inefficiency
- Lack of role-based access control creating security vulnerabilities
- Need for scalable solution handling 500+ student profiles
- Requirement for secure authentication and data protection

**Target Users:**
- Educational institutions (schools, colleges, training centers)
- Administrators managing student records
- Instructors tracking course enrollment and grades
- Students accessing their academic information

### Key Features

- ✅ **Secure Authentication System** - Password hashing with bcrypt, session management, and login attempt tracking
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Three distinct user roles (Admin, Student) with granular permissions
- ✅ **Comprehensive CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for student records, courses, and enrollments
- ✅ **Normalized Database Design** - tables with referential integrity constraints and optimized indexing for performance
- ✅ **RESTful API Architecture** - Clean API endpoints with input validation and proper HTTP methods
- ✅ **SQL Injection Prevention** - Prepared statements and parameterized queries throughout application
- ✅ **Responsive UI Design** - Mobile-first interface using Bootstrap 5 ensuring cross-device compatibility
- ✅ **Data Validation** - Client-side and server-side validation preventing invalid data entry
- ✅ **Accessibility Standards** - WCAG compliant with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

### Built With

## 🧪 Testing

**Manual Testing Conducted:**
- ✅ All CRUD operations for students, courses, enrollments
- ✅ Authentication and authorization flows
- ✅ Form validation (client and server side)
- ✅ Role-based access control enforcement
- ✅ Responsive design across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Database integrity with foreign key constraints

**Test User Accounts Available:**
See installation section for default credentials (remember to change in production!)

## 📱 Responsive Design

**Breakpoints:**
- 📱 **Mobile** (320px - 576px) - Stack layout, touch-optimized buttons
- 📱 **Tablet** (577px - 992px) - Two-column layout where appropriate
- 💻 **Desktop** (993px+) - Full dashboard with sidebar navigation

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44x44px)
- Simplified navigation menu
- Optimized table views for small screens
- Reduced image sizes for faster loading
